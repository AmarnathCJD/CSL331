<h2>System Software and Microprocessors Lab</h2>
<p>This repository contains the source code for lab cycles undertaken as part of the S5 System Software & Microprocessors Lab. The lab exercises focus on implementing fundamental concepts in system software and microprocessor programming.</p>

<h2>Lab Cycles Included</h2>
<p>The repository contains code for the following lab cycles:</p>
<ul>
    <li>**SIC Assembler (Pass 1 & Pass 2)**: Implementation of a two-pass assembler for the SIC assembly language, using C. This involves generating intermediate code, symbol tables, and object code.</li>
    <li>**[Other lab cycles]** (Add the names of other lab cycles here).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To explore the code for each lab cycle, navigate to the corresponding subdirectories within the repository. Each subdirectory contains a README file with instructions on how to compile and run the code.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any improvements or additions to the lab cycles, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.</p>
